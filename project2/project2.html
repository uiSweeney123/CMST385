    <!-- SECTION 1 -->

    <h2>Project Concept</h2>



    <h3>Website Overview</h3>

    This project involves the creation of a <strong>personal portfolio website</strong> designed to showcase my

    skills, projects, and professional background in web and digital design.

    The website will act as a centralized hub for employers, instructors, and collaborators to learn more about my work.

    and demonstrate <strong>foundational HTML and CSS skills</strong>.

    <!-- SECTION 3 -->

    <h2>Wireframe</h2>



    The homepage will include a header with navigation, a hero section introducing who I am,

    and a featured projects section. The design will be clean and minimal to keep focus on content.

    <h2 id="resources">Project Resources</h2>



    One helpful resource for this project is 

    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">

        MDN Web Docs

    </a>,

    which provides detailed documentation on HTML and CSS elements.



    This resource will be used to verify proper tag usage, improve semantic structure,

    and ensure best practices during development.
